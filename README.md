This is a program I've created to help my girlfriend keep track of her book collection. Her collection consists mostly of older books that don't have ISBN numbers, so she wanted a custom software that would allow her to maually add books and control what information she could input about her books.

I do have plans to add ISBN and Google Books support in the future, though.
